Current techniques for separating organelle reads from nuclear reads in WGS data require full reference or partial seed
 sequences for assembling. Current methods to extract mtDNA from WGS data require a short seed sequence to initiate assembly.
Norgal (de Novo ORGAneLle extractor) avoids this requirement by identifying a high frequency subset of k-mers that are predominantly of mitochondrial origin and performing a de novo assembly on a subset of reads that contains these k-mers. It based on k-mer frequencies that takes advantage of mitochondria being present 10-100 times more in a cell than the nucleus.
The mitogenome have a higher read depth compared to the nuclear genome and this difference in the read depth levels can be used to separate the reads into two groups.
The separation of the two types of reads is done by counting occurrences of subsequences of length k in the reads - k-mers - and classifying reads that have k-mers that are found more times than the nuclear read depth as being of non-nuclear origin.
Norgal uses raw short NGS reads from WGS data as input and outputs either a full or partial mitogenome.
